                    comment="A very gentle trainer. He aâ€™int pushy or rough with you especially if you are first timer at the gym. He is patient and persistent. His workout routines are friendly to fit every personâ€™s goal. I walked in to the gym with an excruciating 3yrs-chronic back-pain. I started with 2kgs dumbbells and  One year later, I was able to do a dead lift with 60kgs. Same back, firm back. Thank You Njihia"
